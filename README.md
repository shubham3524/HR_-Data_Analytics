## Problem Statement 
 In today's competitive business environment, effective Human Resources (HR) management is crucial for organizational success. HR departments are responsible for recruiting, developing, and retaining talent, ensuring employee satisfaction, and managing workforce dynamics. However, HR professionals often struggle with making data-driven decisions due to the vast amount of data generated from various HR activities.

The primary challenge is to analyze this HR data effectively to uncover insights that can drive strategic decisions. This involves understanding employee demographics, tracking performance metrics, managing employee turnover, and identifying factors that contribute to employee satisfaction and engagement.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to help organizations improve employee performance and retention (reduce attrition) by creating an HR analytics dashboard.
## Goals
- Visualize Key HR Metrics: Display critical HR metrics such as employee turnover rates, recruitment efficiency, and performance scores.
- Identify Trends and Patterns: Analyze historical data to identify trends and patterns in employee behavior and HR processes.
- Enhance Decision-Making: Provide data-driven insights to support strategic HR decisions, such as workforce planning and talent management.
- Improve Employee Engagement: Identify factors affecting employee satisfaction and engagement to develop targeted interventions.

## Summary From HR Analytics Dashboard
Based on the HR Analytics dashboard, the primary reasons for employee attrition are:

- Salary: Higher attrition rates are observed among employees earning up to $5K, indicating salary dissatisfaction as a major factor.
- Job Role: Positions such as Laboratory Technicians, Sales Executives, and Research Scientists have higher attrition rates, suggesting job role-related factors are influential.
- Age: Employees aged 26-35 years exhibit the highest attrition rates, followed by those aged 18-25 and 36-45, indicating younger employees are more likely to leave.
